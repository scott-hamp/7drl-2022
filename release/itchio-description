This game is a traditional roguelike created by Begebies for the 
  2022 Seven-Day Roguelike. You're stuck on a sinking ship, and 
  must quickly ascend to the next floor before water floods the 
  area, while making sure to grab items to help you survive.

For the Windows version I'd recommended using the terminal from the 
  Microsoft store, (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/),
  as this gives you complete control over the font, colors, etc. I've 
  included my favorite roguelike font, JetBrains Mono, if you want to try 
  the game with it.

If you have any feedback or encounter any bugs, please feel free to 
  let me know. Thanks for playing!
