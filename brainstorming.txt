For 7DRL:
- You have to escape from a sinking ship, going up from the bottom.
- Attacks / abilities are water- / steam-based.
- Enemies try to drown you as each floor slowly fills with water.
- The player must ascend to the next floor before drowing, while still
  picking up enough equipment.
- XP comes from exploring / finding new stuff, not from killing.
